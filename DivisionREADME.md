**Explanation of How The Division Program Works**

1.    Accepting Two Numbers:

·      The program uses the Scanner classto read input from the user.

·      It prompts the user to enter thefirst number (num1) and the second number (num2), both as double values tohandle decimal numbers.

2.    Performing Division and Catching ArithmeticException:

·      The division operation num1 / num2is performed inside a try block.

·      If num2 is zero, Java throws an ArithmeticExceptionbecause division by zero is undefined in mathematics.

·      The catch (ArithmeticException e)block catches this exception and prints the required message: "Cannotdivide by zero!".

3.    Handling Other Exceptions:

·      An additional catch (Exception e)block is included to handle other potential issues, such as invalid input(e.g., if the user enters a non-numeric value). This makes the program morerobust.

·      Finally, block ensures the Scanneris closed to prevent resource leaks.

4.    Displaying a Meaningful Message:

·      When an ArithmeticException occurs(i.e., when the second number is zero), the program outputs "Cannot divideby zero!" as specified.

_Sample Outputs_

_Case 1: Valid Division_

_Enter the first number: 10_

_Enter the second number: 2_

_Result of division: 5.0_

_Case 2: Division by Zero_

_Enter the first number: 10_

_Enter the second number: 0_

_Cannot divide by zero!_

_Case 3: Invalid Input_

_Enter the first number: abc_

_An error occurred: Input string "abc" is not a validdouble_

5.    Key Concept: Exception Handling

·      The program demonstrates exceptionhandling in Java using try-catch blocks. The ArithmeticException isspecifically caught to handle the division-by-zero scenario, ensuring theprogram doesn't crash and instead provides a user-friendly message.
