**Explanation of How Method Overiding Works**

1.    Creating the makeSound() Method inthe Animal Class:

·      The Animal class is the parent classand contains a makeSound() method with a generic implementation that prints"The animal makes a generic sound."

·      This method serves as a templatethat subclasses can override to provide their own specific behavior.

2.    Overriding makeSound() in SubclassesDog and Cat:

·      The Dog class extends Animal andoverrides the makeSound() method to print "The dog barks: Woof!Woof!"

·      The Cat class also extends Animal andoverrides the makeSound() method to print "The cat meows: Meow!Meow!"

·      The @Override annotation ensuresthat the method is correctly overridden from the parent class, helping to catcherrors during compilation if the method signature doesn't match.

3.    Demonstrating Polymorphism:

·      In the Main class, we create objectsof Dog and Cat, but we store them in variables of type Animal. This is anexample of polymorphism, where a parent class reference can point to objects ofits subclasses.

·      When we call myDog.makeSound() and myCat.makeSound(),Java uses the actual type of the object (Dog or Cat) to determine whichoverridden method to execute, not the reference type (Animal). This is known asdynamic method dispatch or runtime polymorphism.

**Output of the Program**

When you runthe program, the output will be:

_Calling makeSound() on Dog object:_

_The dog barks: Woof! Woof!_

_Calling makeSound() on Cat object:_

_The cat meows: Meow! Meow!_

**Key OOP Concepts**

·      Method Overriding: The Dog and Catclasses provide their own implementations of the makeSound() method, overridingthe version in the Animal class. This allows each subclass to define its ownbehavior for the same method.

·      Polymorphism: By using an Animalreference to call makeSound() on Dog and Cat objects, we demonstrate runtimepolymorphism. The JVM determines the actual type of the object at runtime andcalls the appropriate overridden method.

·      This program effectively showcasesmethod overriding and polymorphism in action.
